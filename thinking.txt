I will just put my thoughts here

  let index = selectedArray.indexOf(displayName);
  selectedArray.splice(index, 1);

  This is kinda bad because multiple users might have the same display name and this removes the first match, not the selected match

  When user remove user from button, does not unselect from the list

  I might need to have an array of objects
  {
    displayName: display name
    username: username //Perhaps I can use userID instead. Vulnerabolity is an issue I am not focusing on :D
  }
